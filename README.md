Play Scavenger Hunt with friends at Iowa State

First fully-functioning Android application on a team of 3 others for a required ISU course (ComS 309).
The app allows you to play a "Scanvenger-Hunt" game with friends across the ISU campus as you
"check-in" at a multitude of locations. Used SVN for version-control at the time. Some libraries
used include: Google Maps SDK, Facebook SDK, and Firebase SDK.
